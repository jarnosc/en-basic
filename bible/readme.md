MySpell Dictionary from the Bible in Basic English.

The full Bible has been `sort`ed and `uniq`ed, all proper names removed with `sed`, and spaces removed with `tr`, and the remaining words have been `munch`ed to produce the dictionary.

Details are left as an exercise for the reader.

Now have fun and put your own Revelations in writing.
